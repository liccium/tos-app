## 8. Your Obligations as a User

8.1 Legal Compliance

When using the websites or the Liccium Services, you must not commit any acts or transmit any information that violate any laws or other regulations.

**In the event of violations of the law you may be excluded from using the Liccium Services without notice.**

In particular, without limitation, it is prohibited to

- falsely claim creatorship or rightsholdership in your declaration. It is strictly prohibited to pass off protected works of third parties as your own property or impersonate another natural or legal person,
- provide licence links (URLs) within the metadata of works or assets that infringe the rights of third parties with your licences. This expressly includes infringements of the right to one's own image, third-party copyrights, trademark, patent or other intellectual property rights,
- provide links (URLs) within the metadata of works or assets that lead third parties to third-party services and websites infringing third party intellectual property, such as piracy sites,
- upload works and assets to the Liccium Services that are pornographic, discriminatory, offensive, defamatory, inciting, violent or entice violence, threatening, harassing or defamatory.
    

If you become aware of any third-party content that violates the above restrictions, please contact us immediately at the following e-mail address: reporting@liccium.com.

8.2 Thumbnails can serve as an optional, publicly viewable asset preview. As part of the declaration process, you can decide to make thumbnails of the assets publicly accessible. Depending on your choice, thumbnails generated from the digital media files (not the uploaded digital media assets themselves) may be permanently stored on immutable and persistent peer-to-peer hosting and/or Liccium servers. The thumbnails have a physical resolution of 128 pixels for the larger side of the image.

## 9. Generating ISCC

Liccium Services are using software to generate content-derived identifiers, based on the International Standard Content Code (ISCC), which was published by ISO under ISO 24138:2024. ISCC codes uniquely identify digital media assets (including encodings of text, images, audio, video), using cryptographic and similarity-preserving hashes.

You are aware of and understand that:

- ISCC codes are generated using open source software,  provided under an Apache 2.0 Licence (https://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
- The generation or declaration of an ISCC code in itself does not make any statement or claim about authorship or ownership of the identified content,
- any user, system, or machine with access to the digital asset may also independently generate an identical or similar ISCC code from the identical or similar asset.
- The generation of an ISCC code has no effect on ownership rights to the content. 

**Liccium B.V. is not liable for the software developed by third parties or damages or claims resulting from faults, mistakes and bugs contained within.**

## 10. Asset and Metadata Management

10.1 Liccium Services offers a digital platform for you to provide metadata associated with your work or asset.

Providing third-party personal data without proper consent or justification, or in violation of legal norms such as moral rights, trademarks, patents, or intellectual property rights, is strictly forbidden. Liccium B.V. retains the authority to revoke your access to the services without prior notice if there's a violation or credible suspicion of infringing third-party rights.

Should you identify any content that breaches these stipulations, please promptly notify us at: reporting@liccium.com.

A persistent link (URL) is generated by the Liccium Services to the metadata (“Metadata URL”).

10.2 Based on your specific agreement with Liccium B.V., the company reserves the right to store your assets and metadata on its servers. These assets and metadata can be deleted upon your request. Notably, Liccium B.V.'s servers are owned by Amazon.com, Inc. and are situated in Frankfurt/M., Germany.

If you have a distinct agreement with Liccium B.V. to utilise Liccium Services on-premise, you'll be responsible for your data storage, eliminating the need to upload content to Liccium B.V.'s servers. In such instances, the terms of your specialised agreement with Liccium B.V., termed the "Liccium Engine agreement," will be in effect.

## 11. Declarations

11.1 Liccium Services facilitate the declaration of the ISCC code and a metadata URL to the Liccium registry.

11.2 To make a public declaration, you digitally authorise the transaction using the Liccium app.

This action stores the ISCC code and the metadata to the Liccium registry of verifiable metadata records.

11.3 The Declarations to the Liccium registry enable users, automated systems, and third-party applications to discover, identify, and authenticate the declaration, and to access the provided metadata.

The metadata encompassed in a Declaration is publicly accessible. It may be continuously hosted on immutable and persistent peer-to-peer servers as a part of this service.

**Declarations can be modified, updated, or removed from the Liccium registry. However, the original metadata may be retained in the products's history.** 

**It's crucial to understand that once a public Declaration was made, the data is visible and accessible by third parties. If third parties host or store public metadata, or make a snapshot of the data, the Declaration is beyond the control of Liccium and cannot be revoked or deleted.**

11.4 Liccium B.V. reserves, as part of the preprocessing service, the right to generate all necessary assets for the service and the right to change and amend and create assets and metadata as necessary for the service. This includes saving versions of the original assets in differently edited versions (i.e., in case of images: cropping), this right is solely restricted for the purposes to enable a best possible discoverability of Declarations and its metadata.

11.5 Should you wish for a removal of data under control of Liccium B.V., please send a request specifying the assets with their ISCC codes individually by sending an e-mail to info@liccium.com. We may request further documentation about rights ownership in the course of removal.
